# p13177880 - CTEC3905
Public repo for CTEC3905 practical project work

This repo will contain all of the relevant filse and documentation for the project, a scratch-built website using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Concept
The idea for the site is a portfolio for my various creative works, currently focussing on original music and photography.
By focussing on these two forms of digital media, I can showcase techniques which apply to either image media, audio, or both.

The subject of a creative portfolio also allows for a wide scope of potential creative designs, as the site does not need to conform to any existing standards; individual portfolios are intended to be just that, individual and engaging.

# Language considerations
Since the general idea for the site is to be as aesthetically pleasing as possible whilst presenting the content in an easy to read and navigate manner, good use of HTML and CSS will be imperitive. JavaScript is likely to be relegated to performing more complex animations and transitions which CSS is not capable of. 
The requirement for any backend such as PHP or an SQL database is pretty much non-existent.

# Content considerations
The large bulk of the content will be made up of entirely original work, so copyright is of minimal concern.
Audio showcases will most likely utilise an API from soundcloud, as the content is already availible there. However, if it is deemed suitable for this project, an HTML5/JS audio player may be built
The photography section will likely consist of a gallery. No external sources are needed, so everything can be done with HTML, CSS, and JS.
